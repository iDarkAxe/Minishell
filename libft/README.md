# Library for C Project at 42 # 
These functions are clones of functions that already exist in C. We must mimic their behavior as perfectly as possible.

# How to use #
You can compile all the library at once using
```sh
make
```
Or you can add only a group by using the command :
```sh
make <group>
```
It will add the group the rest of the library already made.

# Groups # 
The functions are in different groups.
`src/`,
`mem/`,
`char/`,
`str/`,
`print/`,
`sort/`,
`swap/`,
`lst/`
